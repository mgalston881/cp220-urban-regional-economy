# Basics

What affects what is where?
* Mobility and transportation costs
* Factors of production
    * Capital
    * Labor
    * Land

## Why study regions?

Global economic restructuring, shift from manufacturing to services. As economies grew more complex (and information/services become more important), urban regions grew. Now, because of the way growth has occurred, we think about economies more as regions than cities.

Shift from vertically to horizontally organized firms, from old Fordist model of having supplies and assembly and distribution all housed in the same place. Shift to more of a networked production structure.

Networks as key unit instead of firms -> we think about spatial economies differently: not thinking about Coca Cola being in Atlanta, but about its network of suppliers and distributors all across the country.

Another reason regions are important: locations themselves have become an economic input. Location used to be important because of the immobility of land and its useful functions, but now we talk about location itself as an input. Soft factors like quality of life. People want to live in the Bay Area, so the location of the Bay Area itself is one of the economic inputs for the firms that choose to locate here.

## Example: Washington and Oregon

Two key sectors in 1990:
* Transportation equipment (Manufacturing specialization, airplanes)
* Resource products/processes (Timber)

| State | Transportation | Resources |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| WA | 5.9% | 10.3% |  
| OR | 0.6% | 15.1% |  

Why the disparity?
* Washington has a better port
- When railway was being built across the US, went first to Seattle
- Boeing set up in Seattle in 1916

These advantages accumulate and there is **path dependency**.

## Regions and Metropolitan Areas

Metro areas:
* Nodal in character
* Have a center and a periphery
* Tend to be more diverse, more heterogeneous
* They tend to have a denser core because of travel and cost efficiencies, and a less dense periphery.

Regions:
* **Characteristics**: Homogeneous across culture, resources
* **Functionality** (designated as a region, top-down designation as an administrative area)
    * EU
    * MPOs in the USA
* **Process**: transactions that create interdependencies between areas. Easiest way to visualize this is a commute shed. This is how the Census Bureau defines metropolitan areas.
* **Autonomy**: Historically cohesive area that can function independently. Example California as 6th largest economy in the world.

**Working definition of a region**:
> A historically evolved, contiguous, bounded, territorial society that possesses a physical environment, a cultural, socio-economic, and political milieu, and a spatial structure that is distinct from other regions, cities, or nations.


## Regional Policy

EU has very well defined regional policy that cuts across functional areas. US does not have formal regional policy (e.g. Department of Regions) - we have *implicit* regional policy.

Many federal policies have regional effects, such as the Farm Bill, Homeland Security, Interstate Highway Act, energy policy, military and defense spending (see `Rise of the Gunbelt`), immigration policy (labor supply and impact on relative growth of different regions), native lands policies.

## Jane Jacobs: Cities and the Wealth of Nations

The main concepts:

* **Import Replacement** as the process by which cities expand. This is a similar idea to import substitution and industrialization (ISI) from development economics.
* **Cities** as where import replacement happens.

Jacobs is an early proponent of *endogenous development*, development from within. Cities have people, people are markets, markets have demand. People generated process.

Five factors:
* Markets - bicycles imported, creates market for repair.  
* Jobs - skill development and diversification, increase in efficiency. All creates a multiplication effect on jobs.
* Technology
* Transplants
* Capital

Types of regions:
* Supply regions - Middle East, Appalachia, Andes (mining), Central Valley. Typically have an abundance of some natural resource. They have distant markets; importers are not in the region, have different cultures, have their own reasons for potentially shifting out of production. Vulnerable to such shifts in production, at the whim of the distant market since they do not produce for themselves.
* Abandoned regions
* Technology and clearance regions
* Transplant regions
* City regions
* Regions without cities
* Bypassed places
