## Malizia and Feser - Understanding Local Economic Development

Theory | Basic Categories | Definition of Development | Essential Dynamic | Strengths & Weaknesses | Applications
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Economic Base Theory | Export or basic/non-basic sectors | Increasing rate of growth in output, income, employment | Response to external changes in demand; economic base multiplier effects | Most popular theory, simple tool short-term prediction. Inadequate long-term theory | Industrial recruitment for export expansion/diversification, expansion of basic industries, import substitution by connecting basic/non-basic industries, infrastructure development
Staple Theory | Exporting industries | Export-led economic growth | Production and marketing of export staple, external demand for staple | Historical perspective; descriptive theory | Build on export specializations, increase competitive advantage, character of economic base shapes political and cultural superstructure
Sector Theory | Primary, secondary, tertiary sectors | Greater sectoral diversity and higher productivity per worker | Income elasticity of demand and labor productivity in primary and secondary sectors | Empirical analysis possible. Categories too general. | Promote sectoral shifts, attract/retain producers of income elastic products
Growth Pole Theory | Industries | Propulsive industry growth leads to structural change | Propulsive industries are poles of growth | General theory of initiation and diffusion of development based on the domination effect | Growth center strategies
Regional Concentration and Diffusion Theories | Commodities and factors, or industries | Higher income per capita | Spread and backwash effects / trickle-down or polarization | Address the dynamics of development | Active government, location of public investment spurs development
Neoclassical Growth Theory | Aggregate (macro) or two-sector regional economy | Increasing rate of economic growth per capita | Rate of saving that supports investment and capital formation | Supply-side model | Gov should promote free trade and economic integration, tolerate social inequality and spatial dualism
Interregional Trade Theory | Prices/quantities of commodities and factors | Economic growth that leads to greater consumer welfare | Price adjustments that result in equilibrium terms of trade; price-quantity effects | Unique emphasis, ignores dynamics of development | Promote free trade; infrastructure dev, efficient local gov
Product Cycle Theory | Products - new, maturing, standardized | Continual creation and diffusion of new products | Innovation, new product dev | Popular among researchers | Promote product innovation and diffusion
Entrepreneurship Theories | Entrepreneurs | Resilience and diversity | Innovation process, new combinations | Mediated theory | Support industrial milieu or ecology for development
Flexible specialization Theories | Production regimes, industrial organization | Sustained growth through agile production, innovation, and specialization | Changes in demand requiring flexibility among producers | Detailed analysis of firm/industry organization, aggregate outcomes and relationships seldom specified | Flexibility through advanced tech, networks among small firms, industry clusters

## Storper - Keys to the City - Ch 1 and 2

Four analytic contexts
* Economic
* Institutional
* Innovation or interaction
* Political or Societal

Concepts:  

**The New Neoclassical Urban Economics (NNUE)**: "Preferences for amenities are central to the choices of individuals and households" (15). Principal amenities are "quality of life" and climate, households and individuals choose to maximize utility, and do so through mobility. Assumes constraints like income, then determines equilibrium spatial distribution of population and output. This defines the size of cities.  

**General Spatial Equilibrium (GSE)**: "Consumers seek to maximize utility, which is a function of those wages, housing expenditures, and amenities; firms seek to maximize profits, and they have the possibility of full factor substitution across locations. Builders supply housing in response to demand and regulation...", etc (15).  

The author appears to find both version of amenity-focused theory to be inadequate - "The world urban system...is not a set of playgrounds or amenity parks but instead a vast system of interlinked workshops."

## Friedmann - The Wealth of Cities

Seven clusters of a city's assets:
* Human assets: basic human needs and quality of life (education, housing, health)
* Organized civil society (self organizing of local citizens)
* Built environment and cultural life (physical heritage, cultural traditions)
* Intellectual and creative assets (universities, 'living human treasures')
* Natural assets (farms, ocean, landscapes)
* Environmental assets (air, water)
* Urban infrastructure (transportation, energy, sewage, communication)

> The true wealth of a city is to be found in the progressive development of its assets base through a concerted and sustained effort, largely from within itself.

Responding to criticisms of endogenous development:
* Not an exclusive strategy
* Upgrading asset qualities itself stimulates foreign investment
* Local savings can be substantial even in poor countries with fiscal discipline
* Capital expenditures needed for endogenous development may not be so large
* Clear priorities for public investment must be established
