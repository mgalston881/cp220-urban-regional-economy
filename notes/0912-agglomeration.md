## Storper - Keys to the City - Chapter 3: The Motor of Urban Economies

Two common cases about geography of jobs in the *tradable* (importable) industries:  
* Jobs concentrate as industries (areas of activity), or
* Industry spreads its functions or phases out among different locations

Economies of cities are filled out by *non-tradable* sectors: home construction, supermarkets, etc. (p.33)

**New Economic Geography** (NEG): the initial insight, as described by Storper (p.34):  

> These researchers wanted to know why countries with such similar underlying characteristics (comparative advantages) trade so much with one another. 
The answer provided is that places with similar underlying characteristics - the type and price of labor and capital, knowledge, transport access, and so on - 
can efficiently specialize in different things as well as trade with one another if industries or firms have economies of scale, 
such that by concentrating production in a small number of places, it is cheaper to produce goods there than to spread production out. 
If the cost savings of such concentration are greater thant the extra transport or trade costs incurred to get products to markets that are rendered more distant by 
such concentration of production, then specialization and concentration will generate trade.

Additionally:
* Scale economies can exist *internally* or *externally* to the firm. In external case, if process of sharing tasks within production chain includes 
relatively high trade costs, firms will concentrate spatially.
* If a market has many varieties, and the varieties are concentrated into large firms/clustered and transported to market, system combines efficiency and variety.
* Concentration of production does not depend on natural resources, climate, and other spatial settings. So why have cities?
    * Transportation/urbanization economies still exist
    * As long as there are some trade costs, it makes sense to concentrate suppliers close to where buyers are located (p. 36). This sets off (in an unresolved chicken-egg way)
    a system in which "workers seek jobs and the income they provide, but also seek variety of consumption opportunities and lower prices." Thus, *self-reinforcing urbanization.*

What goes on inside clusters:
* Sharing
* Matching
* Learning

## Vernon - External Economies

The key argument is that NYC is a locational advantage for "external-economy industries", or those industries that share characteristics such as:
* Need of shops and plants to share common facilities
* Need to tap facilities at high speed
* Need for face-to-face contact

Industries that cluster in NYC tend to have smaller operations / small firm sizes, and firms outside of NYC in those industries tend to have larger operations. 
The latter tend to grow faster because:
* They may be in industries that have matured and have more predictable processes
* They may be in industries that can decompose their processes into different regions

## Chinitz - Contrasts in Agglomeration: New York and Pittsburgh

The core goal of this piece:

> It should be apparent that what I am reaching for is the specification of a function which relates external economies and diseconomies to industry structure, size being held constant. 

Some variables of interest: 

* *Entrepreneurship*: Old assumption is that supply schedule of entrepreneurship is even across all locations. Chinitz argues that more competitive industries actually
 have more entrepreneurs per unit output than more oligopolistic industries. This makes a place like NYC more entrepreneurial than Pittsburgh with its large steel companies.  
* *Capital*:  Also assumed to be invariant of location. Chinitz argues that small firms have greater access to capital close to home, making local capital supply important.
* *Labor*: Beyond the question of differentials in labor cost, Chinitz calls out two factors:
    * Dispersion of dominant employment centers throughout the region, which changes the geography of commuting / labor shed
    * Work schedule: Less predictable work schedules (steel) makes it difficult for women to enter the workforce (this is written in 1961)
* *Land*: Pittsburgh was known at the time as excessibly polluted.
* *Intermediate Goods and Services*: Finally, external economies:

> Large firms incorporate many of these services within their own operations becaue they can achieve scale economies within the firm...
on the other hand, this means that, dollar for dollar, their business is less of a stimulus to the creation of a community of independent suppliers.
