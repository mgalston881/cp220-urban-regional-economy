## Storper - Keys to the City - Chapter 3: The Motor of Urban Economies

Two common cases about geography of jobs in the *tradable* (importable) industries:  
* Jobs concentrate as industries (areas of activity), or
* Industry spreads its functions or phases out among different locations

Economies of cities are filled out by *non-tradable* sectors: home construction, supermarkets, etc. (p.33)

**New Economic Geography** (NEG): the initial insight, as described by Storper (p.34):  

> These researchers wanted to know why countries with such similar underlying characteristics (comparative advantages) trade so much with one another. 
The answer provided is that places with similar underlying characteristics - the type and price of labor and capital, knowledge, transport access, and so on - 
can efficiently specialize in different things as well as trade with one another if industries or firms have economies of scale, 
such that by concentrating production in a small number of places, it is cheaper to produce goods there than to spread production out. 
If the cost savings of such concentration are greater thant the extra transport or trade costs incurred to get products to markets that are rendered more distant by 
such concentration of production, then specialization and concentration will generate trade.
