## From last time: measuring growth and development

Measures that may be more closely associated with *growth*:
* GDP / growth rate
* Wages: distribution and summaries
* Numbers of jobs and residents
* Tax revenue
* Wealth and equity (e.g. property values)

Measures that may be more closely associated with *development*:
* Community services: social, etc. 
* Government spending (also related to growth)
* Human capital development
* Diversity of economy (range of goods and services produced)

Where do these fit?
* Livability indices like climate, etc. 
* Foreign development
* Patents/innovation, entrepreneurship rates, startups

## Comparative vs. competitive advantage

One region has a **comparative** advantage over another if it is better at producing a good than another region. In other words, it's more productive; more output per worker hour or other input resource. 
* Example: Film industry in Southern California

**Competitive** advantage is about *niche*, produce something special. 
* Example: Animation in Bay Area (Pixar)

## Location theory

### Classical theory

Spatial patterns of economic activity; early attempts from 19th century Germany during a time of rapid industrialization and urbanization. People starting to think about intra-city location patterns, systems of cities. City regions that were linked to each other. Alfred Weber (brother of Max) was an early theorist of firm location, based on *transport cost minimization*. Transport was very expensive at this time and was probably the most important cost factor.  

Complications to the simple model:
* Competition
* Transportation network: mode, cost per mile, transshipment costs, geography, service frequency, terminal costs
* Market demand, location, dynamics
* Materials and changing costs
* Labor

Von Thunen (early theorist): agricultural applications of location theory (land rent gradient)  
* Regional Center: grow most expensive and heaviest agricultural products (dairy) to be close to market
* Around the urban core: perhaps no agricultural development because land is still expensive in this zone
* Outside urban core: grow grains

Christaller, Losch: urban systems, central place theory

### Location theory today

What factors make a firm locate in one place or another? (For this example, professional services) 
* Access to labor
* Amenities / lack of disamenities / quality of life factors
  * Crime, transportation infrastructure, climate, health factors
* Tax incentives
* Presence of other firms (in the same sector? or in dependent/related sectors)
* Access to capital, access to markets
* Local government
* Raw materials 
* Universities
* Where the CEO lives (major determinant based on recent survey)
