# Basics

What affects what is where?
* Mobility and transportation costs
* Factors of production
    * Capital
    * Labor
    * Land

## Why study regions?

Global economic restructuring, shift from manufacturing to services. As economies grew more complex (and information/services become more important), urban regions grew. Now, because of the way growth has occurred, we think about economies more as regions than cities.

Shift from vertically to horizontally organized firms, from old Fordist model of having supplies and assembly and distribution all housed in the same place. Shift to more of a networked production structure.

Networks as key unit instead of firms -> we think about spatial economies differently: not thinking about Coca Cola being in Atlanta, but about its network of suppliers and distributors all across the country.

Another reason regions are important: locations themselves have become an economic input. Location used to be important because of the immobility of land and its useful functions, but now we talk about location itself as an input. Soft factors like quality of life. People want to live in the Bay Area, so the location of the Bay Area itself is one of the economic inputs for the firms that choose to locate here.

## Example: Washington and Oregon

Two key sectors in 1990:
* Transportation equipment (Manufacturing specialization, airplanes)
* Resource products/processes (Timber)

| State | Transportation | Resources |
| -- | -- | -- |
| WA | 5.9% | 10.3% |
| OR | 0.6% | 15.1% |

Why the disparity?
* Washington has a better port
- When railway was being built across the US, went first to Seattle
- Boeing set up in Seattle in 1916

These advantages accumulate and there is **path dependency**.

## Regions and Metropolitan Areas

Metro areas:
* Nodal in character
* Have a center and a periphery
* Tend to be more diverse, more heterogeneous
* They tend to have a denser core because of travel and cost efficiencies, and a less dense periphery.

Regions:
* Subnational areas
* Homogeneous across some characteristic (culture, resources)
* Functionality (designated as a region, top-down designation as an administrative area)
